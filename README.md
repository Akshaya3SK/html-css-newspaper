# ðŸ“° Bestnews Newspaper

Welcome to **Bestnews Newspaper**, a static webpage designed using pure HTML and CSS. This was my very first web development project, created over a year ago when I was starting out. It simulates the layout and content of an online newspaper with sections for **sports**, **politics**, and **economics**.
